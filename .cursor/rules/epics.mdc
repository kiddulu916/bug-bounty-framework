**Epic Planning & Tracking System**
<!-- AI INSTRUCTIONS: Always follow these rules. Never modify this section. -->

**Purpose**: Plan and track large initiatives using the hierarchy: EPIC GROUP ‚Üí EPIC ‚Üí PHASE ‚Üí STEPS

**Hierarchy Definitions**:
- **EPIC GROUP**: Optional grouping of related epics
- **EPIC**: Large collection of features/capabilities  
- **PHASE**: Major milestone within an epic
- **STEP**: Individual feature within a phase

**AI Usage Rules**:
1. **Epic Creation**: When user requests epic planning, create comprehensive plans here
2. **Architecture Integration**: Always consider architecture.mdc when planning epics and include architectural impact in epic steps
3. **No Execution**: Never execute epic work - that happens in workflow_state.mdc  
4. **Natural Language Processing**: Translate user requests into epic context for workflow integration
5. **Progress Updates**: Update epic status when user reports progress or workflow completes
6. **Epic Search**: Search existing epics when user mentions epic work to set proper workflow context

**Context Limits**: Maximum 3 active epics to maintain AI effectiveness

**EPICS PLANS**
<!-- Stores and tracks the EPIC GROUP, EPIC, PHASE and STEP type of plans.  Only to be modified and used by an AI -->

## EPIC MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

### Epic State Management
**State Transitions**:
```
PLANNED ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETED
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì            ‚Üë
 CANCELLED ‚Üê BLOCKED ‚Üê ‚îÄ ‚îÄ ‚îò
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì
 ARCHIVED ‚Üê PAUSED
```

### Update Guidelines
- **Automatic Updates**: Epic steps are updated automatically when workflow completes with epic reference
- **Manual Updates**: Can manually update step progress and notes during development
- **Phase Completion**: Phases automatically marked complete when all steps reach 100%
- **Epic Completion**: Move completed epics to history section
- **Context Management**: Archive epics older than 6 months

### Step Status Tracking
- **Status Icons**: ‚è≥ PLANNED, üîÑ IN_PROGRESS, ‚úÖ COMPLETED, üö´ BLOCKED
- **Completion Percentage**: 0% (planned) ‚Üí 25%, 50%, 75% ‚Üí 100% (completed)
- **Progress Dates**: Track started, last updated, and completed dates
- **Progress Notes**: Document decisions, blockers, and key developments

### Portfolio Management
- **Max Active Epics**: Keep only 2-3 active epics to maintain AI context effectiveness
- **New Epic Planning**: If at limit, complete or pause existing epics before adding new ones
- **Epic Focus**: Use workflow-state.mdc for detailed step execution, epics.mdc for high-level tracking

### AI Epic Management Patterns

#### **When User Requests Epic Work**
1. **Search existing epics**: Look for matching epic names or features
2. **Identify step context**: Find specific phase and step user is referencing
3. **Set workflow context**: Configure workflow state with epic reference
4. **Provide epic context**: Include step requirements during blueprint phase

#### **When User Reports Progress**  
1. **Find current work**: Identify which epic step user is working on
2. **Update step status**: Modify completion percentage and notes
3. **Update dates**: Set last updated timestamp
4. **Check phase completion**: Update phase status if all steps complete

#### **When User Requests Epic Planning**
1. **Create new epic**: Use simplified template in ACTIVE EPICS section
2. **Structure phases**: Break down epic into 2-4 phases
3. **Detail steps**: Add 2-5 steps per phase with requirements and acceptance criteria
4. **Set realistic scope**: Ensure epic fits within 3-epic portfolio limit

### Realistic Expectations
- Epic updates happen through AI interactions based on user prompts
- AI manages epic file updates, users provide natural language instructions
- Epic planning serves as AI memory and workflow integration context
- Focus on AI-driven epic management rather than manual file editing
