# Cursor Rule Organization and Codification
This file contains all cursor rules that should be followed during development. When asked to remember a cursor rule, it will be added to the appropriate section below. All rules in this file must always be followed unless explicitly overridden by the user. 

## Rule Locations and Scope

- **/**: Contains rules and guidelines that apply to the entire application, across all workspaces and domains. Use this location for any rule that should be remembered and enforced globally.
- **/[[domain]]**: e.g.  Contains rules and guidelines that apply only to the [[DOMAIN]] portion of the application. Use this location for rules specific to the [[DOMAIN]] codebase,

## Best Practices
- **All Cursor rules must use the `.mdc` extension.** Do not use `.md` or other extensions for rules files.
- Always write and update rules in the correct workspace according to their intended scope.
- Reference global rules from workspace-specific rules if needed, but do not duplicate content.
- When in doubt, prefer to place rules in the most restrictive (specific) workspace that matches their scope.

This meta-rule ensures clarity and consistency in rule management across the project. Update this file if the rule organization strategy changes.

## Rule addition instructions
When the user asks to "remember a cursor rule", add it to the appropriate section below or create a new subsection if needed. 
Always include:
- Clear rule description
- Context for when it applies
- Any exceptions or special cases
- Date added (as a commnet)
- Keep the rule as short as possible without sacrificing clarity and understanding

IMPORTANT: If below rules get larger than 500 lines, break up the rules into meaningful groups and store them as separate files in .cursor/rules directory starting with rules- prefix.  Then make sure to add the reference in this file to it with short instructions on how to read it and follow it.
